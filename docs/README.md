5. **Market Context** (10%) — VIX, SPY/QQQ trends
6. **Sector Performance** (15%) — Relative strength
7. **Momentum** (15%) — RSI, 52-week range
8. **Sentiment** (10%) — Fear/Greed, shorts, insiders

### Signal Thresholds

| Score | Recommendation |
|-------|----------------|
| > +0.33 | **BUY** |
| -0.33 to +0.33 | **HOLD** |
| < -0.33 | **SELL** |
